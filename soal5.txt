for me there little step

first check the opening and closing php tags, don't let space and

And this Some functions modifying the HTTP header are
such as 

- header / header fa-remove
- session start / session regenerate id
- setcokkie / setrawcookie

so I will chek second above, so if in second above this still error
I will check I think there some corrupt file, so I will change this file
