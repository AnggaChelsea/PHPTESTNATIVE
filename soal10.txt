There is broken window in house.

Then I asked who broke the window :

Gregory : I was not !

April : I didn’t do it

August: April was.

June : August says the truth

(Two of them said the truth and two them said lie)

I ask them again :

Gregory : It was June

April : August didn’t do it

August : April didn’t do it!

June : Gregory was lying.

Who broke the window ? Please explain the logic.
