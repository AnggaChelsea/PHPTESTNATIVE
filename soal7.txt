Question 
What does MVC stand for and what does each component do?

Answer
MVC stands for MODEL VIEW CONTROELLER.
The controller handles data passed to it by the view
and also passed data to the view. Its responsible
for interpretation of the data sent by the view and 
dispersing that data to the appropriate models awaiting
results to pass back to the view. Very little,
if any business logic should be occurring in th controller

for example in my experience use framework MVC such as

in Javascript Angularjs is not Angular
above framework MVC
